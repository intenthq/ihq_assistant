| 3 | Must | Audience Maker | Guide users on the AM UI and limit Data used for expansions | Understand what kind of data limitations we need to implement in the Audience Maker when users want to request an expansion. The current state of our modelling and guidance from Data science is that Brands are the best seeds for expansion and through R&D we’ve identified that using more than 2 Brands doesn’t give an audience output that we have a lot of confidence in(similarity score shows a lot of spikes in the data.) We want all audience requests to produce quality outputs, this epic is for us to guide users towards achieving their campaign goals more accurately. | We can only use Brands or Interests at the moment but we need to identify and validate what are the main data points needed to make our expansion modelling give the best output as possible consistently. We should limit that for requests made through the product as this will optimise the data sent when requests have been made. It is important for us to understand what is being requested so we can help the users understand the limitations of potential requests and insights.

We also understand that It takes a lot of reviewing and card exploration to validate lookalike audience's feasibility for a campaign. We believe incorporating NLG into the AM product will reduce this friction point for users and give them the ability to understand the data at a glance. This has impact on time to activation because if users are able to get a high level summary of the relevant data insights from their lookalike audience expansion, they will have increased confidence to submit these for approval. NLG will be highlighting the specifically relevant insights to them in human readable language therefore making it suitable for different types of users (BI/Campaign Managers/Marketers).

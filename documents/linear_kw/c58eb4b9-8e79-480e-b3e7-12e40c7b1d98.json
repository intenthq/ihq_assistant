  "title": "Add learner context metadata storage to the knowledge base",
  "description": "Whether simply for future reference, or as input to a subsequent learner where there is a pipeline, it would be useful for the context used to determine a mapping to be available in and retrievable from the knowledge base.\n\nThis not only saves re-fetching the relevant data from the web, but also ensures that we have a record of what the data *was* at the time a learner made its decision, regardless of any subsequent changes to the source.\n\nConsiderations:\n\n* storage space\n* impact on graph database performance\n* metadata exposure to clients if deployed on prem\n\nTBD: structure; think about whether we should store then even for a failed update.",

## Platform Accesses üîí

### GitHub

We use GitHub for version control using git.

As of February 2023, there are two things you need to get access to our git repositories:

- **(1) A UAM ticket sent by your manager**

An access request should be included in an UAM ticket sent by your manager, so make sure your manager sent that. This request will need the following:

- Your GitHub profile (either linking your personal GitHub or creating a new account using your Intent HQ email)
- Specify you would like to be added to the **data science group**, you will be added to the data science group giving you access to the majority of our repos (you may still need to request access to repos owned by other teams i.e. `pipeline-process` )
- **(2) Go to Opal.dev**

For any source code access, you need to use [Opal.dev](Opal.dev) (accessible from Okta plugin on your browser). In Opal.dev:

  - First connect your github account in settings ([https://app.opal.dev/user/settings](https://app.opal.dev/user/settings)) *****
  - Then in Resources section, you can request access to the Data Science github group. That gets sent to the respective approvers 
  - If you need access to other repos, you can request access to those as well.

After that, you will need to accept the invitation pending in your github account.

***** If you use your personal git profile, you will need to to add your IHQ email address as your secondary email to your Github profile.



*If you have issues with this process, you can get in touch with @**[Evgeny Lazarev](https://app.slack.com/team/U024Y4W4R)* 



Before you can clone any Github projects you must add your ssh key to the account, please find some relevant links below

- [Generating an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- [Adding an SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
- [Cloning a Repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)

### Other Platforms

Your line manager should have submitted a User Access Management (UAM) ticket for your other platform accesses

You can check out the portal [here](https://intenthq.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/6) - you may be granted access right-away since they are working their way through the ticket

An example of the ticket and the accesses requested is shown in the below image for reference





**Databricks - Florela/Manuel to update**

1. **NDA‚Äôs**
2. **Raise UAM for accessing ML**

## Setting up the local environment üíª

[Follow this doc for setting up your local environment](https://intenthq.slab.com/posts/setting-up-the-local-environment-%F0%9F%92%BB-eel5yqc4)

This article also covers configurations required for docker, SSH config and tunnelling, choosing the editor for development, and Insomnia config.

### Troubleshooting when you run `local-env/setup`
| Step | Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| sdkmanInstall | java versions not found for M1 chips | check out t[his guide](https://itnext.io/how-to-install-x86-and-arm-jdks-on-the-mac-m1-apple-silicon-using-sdkman-872a5adc050d) for installing through SDKMAN on Apple Silicon. You may need to run `source "$HOME/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh`" in the same terminal window before running the setup script to ensure it works |
| homebrew | docker installed failed for M1 chips | remove ln36 `cask docker` from the Brewfile[There is a separate distro for Apple Silicon](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/apple-silicon/) |
| npmPackages |  | Despite the fact that Brewfile includes `node@12`, you may need to run `brew install node` before the npm package install will work correctly. |
| sshStuff |  | The permissions/ownership of `/usr/local/bin` aren‚Äôt compatible with the script.

## ~~Setting up AWS roles~~

This process - accessing AWS via Okta - still works but is about to be deprecated. See the next section on the more up-to-date and recommended way.

This browser extension will make it easier to switch roles and accounts when logged into the AWS console. You can set it up before getting access to AWS but you won‚Äôt be able to use it. 

Install the [AWS Switch Roles](https://github.com/tilfin/aws-extend-switch-roles) extension.

Open its ‚ÄúOptions‚Äù





Add the config from [here](https://github.com/intenthq/hello/blob/master/local-env/assets/aws-extend-switch-roles.txt).

Then use the extension, not the role switch drop-down on the AWS page, for switching. Note that automatically setting the region doesn‚Äôt always work.

You can do the same in Citrix, or just use the built-in Switch Role and copy the values for VZW from this config the first time.

Note that the configuration may includes accounts that you will not have access to. In this case, clicking the role will lead to a screen that looks like the one below. This means you cannot actually select it - or that you are in the wrong main AWS account (currently only applicable to Orange Spain).



## Accessing AWS via Opal

Accessing AWS:

- Go to **Opal.dev** through Okta (e.g. via the plugin)
  - 
- Go to **AWS IntentHQ** in **Apps**
  - 
- Go to the environment you need access to, e.g. intenthq-verizon
  - For demo/setup purposes, you can select **IntentHQ Development**, which is the dev environment
- Select the **Engineer** role (this is the permissions closest to our requirements)
- Click **Request** and submit a request
  - 
  - For the dev environment, it should auto-approve for you
  - Client environment will need a human to approve the request, but it should typically take just a few minutes
- Then go back through the same pathway Apps ‚Üí IntentHQ Development ‚Üí Engineer and click **Connect** this will open AWS in an authenticated window for you
  - 
- Click the **Access AWS Console** to open the console in a new tab
  - 
  - Or copy and paste the `opal` command in your terminal to authenticate there (if you need command line AWS access)
    - You might need to install the Opal CLI first: `brew install opalsecurity/brew/opal-security`
- Note: The access will timeout after 1hr, you can restart this by reconnecting through Opal and refreshing your old tab

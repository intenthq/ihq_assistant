# Why go cross-functional and revise our processes?

### The aims for cross-functional teams include:

- Strengthen staff **wellbeing**
- Strengthen our focus on purpose and clarity to:
  - Increase **productivity**
  - Increase **innovation** 
  - Solve more **customer** & market problems 
- Be **bolder** and create value

Migrating to a cross-functional structure combined with revised product development processes will help us move faster and do bigger things. 

## Foster Culture of Thinker Doer

ProdTech aims to foster a “*Thinker Doer*” culture where individuals collaborate to innovate, solve problems and implement solutions. This is a counterculture to the hierarchy approach where leadership or management find solutions to the issues and individuals carry out the tasks given to them to deliver the solution. 

See Steve Jobs's talk on the topic for inspiration: the doers are the thinkers.

## Accelerate learning velocity

Migrating to a cross-functional structure combined with revised product development processes will help us move faster and do bigger things. Our process changes, coupled with continuous improvement driven by team retro’s and check-in feedback, will focus on a bias to action to iterate (and learn) faster. Thinner slices will help us know as we go and make better decisions faster. 



## Context switching, high tech debt and queue length kill productivity

When the phrase productivity is raised, it is often tied to project progress. We will reduce the level of multi-tasking, tech debt-wangling and process friction. 



## Teams delivering value

Each team should be able to deliver value with minimal dependency on a separate team completing their work. This concept does not mean we want teams to solve the same problems, such as security or visualisations. Technology should be shared across teams. Some teams will build solutions to enable others to create repeated value, for example, by showing newly created insights in IE. All work must be able to satisfactorily answer one question, “**How will this create value for our customers or market?**”.



## Bad process vs Good process

Our product development process is being updated, to support cross functional working, empower technical staff to move faster and bring product managers closer to sales teams. 

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| **Bad Process** | **Good Process** |
| Encourages mindlessness | Encourages mindfulness |
| Inflexible to local challenges | Flexible to local challenges |
| Set in stone “because” | Adaptable, frequently improved |
| Mostly “pushed” | Mostly “pulled” |
| Automatic or forced | Core principles understood |
| Reduces quality or quantity of conversations | Encourages conversations & collaboration |
| One-sided value | Value to all participants |
| Detached from outcomes  | Increases confidence in outcomes |
| Disconnected from the customer | Delivers value to end customers |
| Control and dictated | Guidance and navigated |
| Saftey proxy | Enhances trust  |


# Starting with four cross-functional teams

There will be four cross functional teams. The team sizes and resources will be reviewed regularly. Technical Staffers will be encouraged to periodically move between teams in order to reduce IQ silos and to support personal development ambitions. 



### What exactly is the “Forward Deployed Team”? 

The forward deployed team sits between Build and Serve with teams members from both departments. Instead of a product manager, client needs are defined by a project manager (eg Kalin). The team has the skill set to support pre-sales with identification of use cases, ROI metrics, data requirements, provisioning of demos, technical support, provisioning of PoCs and onboarding. The ML engineers and data scientists and temporary design or app eng resources are capable of handling bespoke customer requirements. The team is also responsible to maintain certain automation tooling. The cross functional nature of this team at the beginning of the client journey will ensure that all teams are aligned in terms of the value that can and needs to be delivered. It will also ensure seamless hand-off between POV and commercial delivery.



The Build FTE will be line managed by an engineering manager, in the same manner as all the other technical staffers. The Serve FTE will be managed by the existing Serve structure. Automation tooling work and customer technical solutions will be supported by the Director of Technology and require oversight from the ProdTech Board as are all other technology stack and architecture decisions. Significant (to be defined) bespoke development requires approval from the Product Board which is responsible for maximizing ROI from technology investments. 

# Managing teams and projects

The role of management or leadership is create space for teams to be successful and create meaningful value. Sticking with Steve Jobs for explanation, this video (nearly 30 years on from the first video) explains this well.

## Engineering management create space for team autonomy

The concept of engineering management will be optimised and extended across the whole department.

The promise of engineering manager to technical staff **is:** 

- Responsible for wellbeing and personal develop plan for technical staff. 
- Responsible for process improvement.
- Responsible for allocation of technical staff to projects.
- Responsible for mobility of technical staff between teams.
- Provide an escalation channel for technical staff at times of challenge.
- Support and coach technical staff to follow process. 
- Support connecting individuals together to support or mentor. 
- Working with peers and the ProdTech board drive improvements for team productivity, motivation and wellbeing. 
- The engineering manager role might be, but does not have to be the technical expert in a specific function. Communities of practice provide cross team best practice, as well as mentoring and support. 

The role of engineering manager is **not**:

- Not to allocate daily tasks to technical staff. 
- Not to track on a daily basis individuals completion of tasks.
- Not to troubleshoot technical problems. *unless they happen to be technical specialist in the area.

## Product managers give teams valuable purpose

The focus of the product manager changes in a cross functional team. 

The promise of product manager to the team **is:** 

- Accountable for identifying the next most valuable set of problems to invest the teams limited resources on, in order to support the companies objectives. 
- Accountable for product hypothesis validation. 
- Responsible for saying “not yet”. 
- Responsible for tracking value creation vs cost.
- Responsible for capturing evidence, idea management and listening to sales & the market.
- Support the team to understand the problem. 
- Support the team to and make design or technical trade offs.
- Support the team to make decisions best aligned with objectives and commercial viability. 
- Support unblocking the team.
- PR for the team and communicate on behalf of the team, including timescales, 
- Collaborate with sales and CS to set them up for success. 
- Support with department wide project planning. 
- Support and challenge the team around problem solution fit. 
- Support and challenge the team to increase learning velocity (smaller slices of work). 

The role of product manager is **not**:

- Not to design the solution. 
- Not to tell engineers what to build. 
- Not to commit to deadlines - the team does that together. 
- Not to take “requirement orders” from sales. 

## Communities of practice to help individuals master their discipline

Principal individual contributors will support the department sharing knowledge and experience across technical staff within the community of practice. Communities of practice are not limited to ProdTech and welcome in other iHQ staff such as people from Serve. Job titles will not restrict participation in communities of practice. 

The following communities of practice will be encouraged. 

1. Data Science
2. Infrastructure Operations
3. Application Engineering 
4. Data Engineering
5. Product Management & Design 

Most community meetings and activities will be organic and organised by the community for the community. Communities of Practice will aim to share learning and document principles to inform decision making. 

## ProdTech leaders help teams push boundaries 

The ProdTech leaders oversee operations across ProdTech. This group of people promise to help teams push boundaries and challenge decisions. Their ProdTech leaders **will**:

- Make hiring decisions
- Support with planning upcoming projects
- Drive the decision making of department wide tech stack decisions
- Support architecture decisions 
- Support and challenge technical processes changes
- Drive action to remove blockers
- Provide technical support department wide
- Recommend approval for spending and purchases

The ProdTech leaders are **not:**

- Not a stage gate to approve teams decisions other than spending money.
- Not line management (doesn’t exclude line mangers from being part of the group)

## What does the “Director of Cloud Technology” actually do?

This is a new position, which temporarily will be filled by Sangram. The role will lead the design, implementation, and optimisation of our data infrastructure, pipelines, and platforms. This is a technical authority, driving the strategic vision for data architecture and ensuring our systems are robust, scalable, and efficient. This role is not a line manager and has no staff. The role reports directly to the CPTO and operates across all teams required. The position is expected to commit code and on work on projects both individually or inside other teams. 

## How teams run projects

To improve mobility across teams, give leadership visibility to challenge and support, and reduce complexity all teams will standardise how projects are ran. This means standardising the management or planning tools we use, the product planning process we follow, the vocabulary we use, and the metrics we measure.

Inside each team significant pieces of work will be called projects. Each project will have team members (from inside the team) play specific roles for the project. This is designed to encourage “Thinker Doers” and provide and opportunity for personal growth. 

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
| --- | --- |
| **Project Role (inside team)** | **Description** |
| Product Lead | Clarifies the problem being solves, explores the risks, justifies the ROI, communicates to stakeholders |
| Tech Lead(s) | Drives the solution concept and architecture. Communicates the progress of implementation.  |
| Experience Lead | Ensures the customer experience will be delightful  |


Projects are an investment to contribute to a return. Funding for a project will be overseen by across the department by the Product Board. The Product Board will include senior stakeholders from across the business. 

A full product development lifecycle process will be outlined designed to increase focus, create transparency and set teams up for success.

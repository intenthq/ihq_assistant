### Target Audience

Who is experiencing this problem? Be as specific as possible. What types (i.e. personas) of users and customers should you focus on first? (Hint: Who buys your product or service? Who uses it? Who configures it? Etc)

### Problem overview

Describe the problem (or opportunity) youâ€™re trying to solve. Why is it important to our users and our business? What insights are you operating on? And if relevant, what problems are you not intending to solve?

(Hint: Consider your current offerings and how they deliver value, changes in the market, delivery channels, competitive threats and customer behaviour.)

# Appetite

### Goals & Success

What does success look like? What metrics are you intending to move? Explain why these metrics are important if not obvious. Can include - 

### Business Outcomes 

How will you know you solved the business problem? What will you measure? 

(Hint: What will people/users be doing differently if your solutions work? Consider metrics that indicate customer success like average order value, time on site, and retention rate.)

### User Outcomes & Benefits

Why would your users seek out your product or service? What benefit would they gain from using it? What behaviour change can we observe that tells us they've achieved their goal?

(Hint: Save money, get a promotion, spend more time with family)

### Non-goals

1. List explicit areas we do not plan to address
2. Explain why they are not goals
3. These are as important and clarifying as the goals

### Risks

What are the potential threats to achieving success? Are there external or legal risks to consider?

# Solution

### Key features

Give an overview of what youâ€™re building. This could include an organised list of features or a discussion of what youâ€™re not building.

ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Add sketches, wireframes, or whiteboards from Miro.

### Key flows

Show some mocks/embeds of the experience. Link to any other documentation as necessary. In general, itâ€™s helpful to organise these around certain user journeys / use cases. Show enough of a clickthrough where people can walk away with a reasonable understanding of how the product works.

ðŸ’¡ Pro tip: Embed a live Figma file to visualise key flows right in your PRD

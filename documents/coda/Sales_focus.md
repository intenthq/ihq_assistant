**Questions**: 

1. Given the definitions in the table above...

Assume we achieved £6m revenue in year 1, and our revenue goal for the next year was £16m. We would need another £10m in revenue growth. Assuming that a quarter of the target revenue growth was achieved through incremental growth within our existing client base, we would need to generate circa £7-8m of new business revenues.

What’s the best deal mix? Play with the table above....

How achievable is your plan? and how manageable?

1. What can we do to accelerate this?

### What are Telco clients actually buying

1. At initial meeting: **the vision**
   1. A transformed customer experience that helps ease the rev/margin pressure
   2. O2 and VZ experience
   3. Quantification of the promises
2. **What tips them over the edge:**
   1. **Seeing** / believing how new (surprising) insight about customers will make them money (essentially Customer AI, and enrichments) e.g. seeing “persistent complainers”
   2. **Being able to SEE whats’s happening in their customer base** (IE) - interestingly this seems to be a reason for the churn team at VZ to buy as well. “Holding a mirror to the business”.
3. **What makes them move faster?**
   1. Quantifying whats in it for them — Forecasting an **ROI for the use cases they are interested in**
   2. Dealing with the thorny issues of privacy, build/buy & data availability upfront (by enlisting their support)
   3. Getting **exec support and buy in** via initial consulting
   4. Proving something they care about that has lots of $ attached (like churn)

### What are our primary challenges in closing sales

1. **Length of sales cycle.** 
   1. *Goal*: Reduce it from 18m to <9 mths
2. **Overcoming privacy concerns.** (privacy is a major blocker, less a legal issue, more brand reputation)
   1. *Goal*: Make ‘Privacy Controls’ and ‘Graduated Consent’ selling points; deal with it upfront 
3. **No on-ramp product**
   1. *Goal*: Find an on-ramp that’s easy to buy (non expensive, sticky, and has inherent growth features) and doesn’t require services nor access to sensitive data
4. **Build vs Buy**
   1. *Goal*: Demonstrate we can help the IT and DS teams deliver what the business wants in a way they cannot. Engage as an enabler of enhanced DS team performance.
5. **No platform demo**
   1. *Goal*: Have one (and be impressive in delivery)
6. **Cost requires Board / C level endorsemen**t. (Harder for normal sales-people). 
   1. *Goal:* Research accounts, build multi-fronted prospecting plans that proactively address stakeholder needs & issues

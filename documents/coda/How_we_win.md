## Our Biggest value accelerator: **Growth in Licence Revenue**



### 1. How we win at *accelerating licence opportunities*

>> **By having public Client references**
>> e.g. The Verizon / Intent shared stage at the 2020 AWS conference, CBL, O2
>> **By having an “On-ramp” product**
>> That doesn’t need network data (so there is less resistance to starting)
>> That still demonstrates we “know more” about your customers
>> Additional owned data feeds (call centre, website etc)
>> New third party Customer Intent data
>> That’s easy to integrate
>> Thats fundamentally self-serve
>> Which helps us launch into new sectors (because it doesn’t need Telco network event data)
>> **By leveraging Partners**
>> “Upstream Partners”
>> Consulting partners (e.g. Acxiom, Comviva, PWC, Merkle) have strong existing relationships, they are a key to accelerating the sale.
>> Data partners (e.g. NTT) have complementary data analytics capabilities that could enhance some important use-cases (e.g. Truck-roll) - and also may have strong existing relationships
>> “Downstream Partners”
>>  Decisioning and Channel partners’ (e.g. IMI/Pega/Lida) where their performance is enhanced by our deliverables 
>> By offering **value** to partners
>> More consulting $ (eg for PWC) or more core business (eg AWS)
>> opportunity to create recurring revenue on top of (or through) the Customer ML Platform & feature catalogue (eg Faculty AI)
>> **By entering new sectors**
>> Where our products and their inherent capabilities have a strong fit to the sector (see “Future Markets” [https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_suwlg](https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_suwlg))
>> current focus is on expansion into the retail, ecommerce or finance sectors

### 2. How we win *at signing Licences*

>> **Knowing more about a customer** and quantifying the ROI from use-case delivery
>> **Why?** 
>> The right insight (e.g. about to churn or call a call-centre) *is worth millions in margin*
>> It’s insight they currently don’t have
>> **What? Customer AI from**
>> All owned customer signals (e.g. website visits, call centre interactions, offer responses)
>> Network data
>> **Making it easy to operationalise that knowledge**
>> **Why?**
>> Operationalising the 360 profile to every touchpoint is (very) hard:
>> Consistency (changes to attributes over time /  between channels)
>> Near Real time  — specifically nr real time predictions that affect service cost
>> Brittle, hard wired ETLs
>> Access features/models
>> **What?** 
>> Our data platform (Our platform is uniquely built to solve these issues (user centric, computed profiles, near real-time)
>> 8Speed of model deployability
>> Downstream Integrations (IMI, Adobe, Pega, In-house etc - Making it super easy to consume IHQ data)
>> **Improve privacy by turning privacy policy into live controls**
>> **Why?** 
>> Given we process highly sensitive data, privacy control is a given, yet....
>> Privacy teams have no way to automate enforcement of policy, and therefore mitigate legal/financial risk
>> **What?** 
>> A comprehensive privacy fabric
>> Embedded data privacy
>> Privacy controls
>> Data driven privacy videos
>> **Helping teams discover and evaluate new insight**
>> **Why?** 
>> It takes a very long time for customer teams to the impact of customer behaviour (and changes to it) and action those (months, issue by issue)
>> **What?** 
>> Ability to evaluate (response & financial impact)
>> Real-time customer insight
>> New insights (automatically generated, with action prompts)
>> The dual capabilities of the Insights Explorer
>> data interrogation
>> story-telling

### 3. How we win at *accelerating licence revenues*

>> **By focussing our sales efforts on Medium sized (5-20m subs) customers** 
>> It will give us the greatest revenue relative to effort:  ( [https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_suwlg](https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_suwlg))
>> We want to reduce our dependency on a small number of clients ([https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_su4My](https://coda.io/d/_dfph4wUu6-Z/_su4My))
>> It’s OK to opportunistically sell to smaller businesses, provided we offer familiar use-cases and manage the cost of ongoing support
>> In fact, this is the best strategy for continents with less profitable Telco sectors such as LatAm, CentrAm & Africa
>> **By having Professional services focussed on:**
>> Leveraging value from the Customer AI and platform by applying new uses cases (Advanced Analytics, Applied Data Science) in “Insight Packages”
>> Accelerating our product adoption within the client
>> Embedding our tech in customer workflows
>> Continuous Insight generation
>> Training and support
>> **By having partners & third parties build on-top of the platform**
>> Accelerates value for the Client
>> Creates a virtuous cycle

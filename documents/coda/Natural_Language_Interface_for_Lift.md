# Executive summary

**(IHQ) Business problem**: AI development in the most recent months setup **market trends and expectations around generative AI and large language models** that the IHQ product portfolio doesnâ€™t yet quite meet. This is particularly important for the business are weâ€™re currently planning an investment round. Furthermore, we believe there will be an increasing **user expectation to interact with software in natural language.**

**User problem**: While our data visualisation tool continues to be a hit amongst clients and prospects, users **struggle to filter and segment their customers**. We believe that a natural language interface will **significantly shorten the time it takes campaign managers to explore data and build audiences**.

**Proposed solution:** We aim to **develop an interface to allow users to query and segment their customer data in natural language**. To do this, we plan to **host and use an open source LLM** which will positively impact our experience and knowledge of the newly emerged technology.

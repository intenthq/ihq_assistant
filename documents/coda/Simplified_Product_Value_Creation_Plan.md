When considering the Product VCP, we should remind ourselves of the product vision and high-level product strategy. 

## Product Vision

" We will make consumer intent available and actionable to *all* businesses of *all* sizes 

" We’re setting a new standard: every consumer interaction becomes an opportunity to inspire, connect, and delight

## Insights and Intents

We often use the words “insights and intents” as if they mean the same thing. They do not mean the same thing.  
  
**Insights** are current, static or historical descriptions of consumers or their behaviour. EG is female, interested in sports, and listens to country music.  
  
**Intents** are descriptions of consumer behaviour that have not yet happened. EG intends to buy a ticket to watch a country band or is considering booking a trip abroad to watch a rugby match.

1. To sell to 10s of customers, we must have products that look commercial grade with standard deployments and configuration options. 

## Value Assumptions for 2025

A **Value Assumption** is the belief that a product, feature, or solution will deliver value to customers and align with business goals. It is the underlying hypothesis that customers will find a proposed solution beneficial, desirable, and worth adopting.

**Key Components of a Value Assumption:**

1. **Customer Perception of Value** → Do customers see this as useful, beneficial, or necessary?

2. **Behavioural Change** → Will customers adopt or switch to this solution?

3. **Willingness to Pay or Engage** → Is the solution compelling enough for customers to pay for or use?

4. **Business Impact** → Will this contribute to revenue, retention, or strategic goals?

5. **Competitive Advantage** → Is this a better or differentiated solution compared to alternatives?

The following value assumptions form the basis for the 2025 product strategy

- Customer experience must be friction-free and guided, including technical users or stakeholders. This means clear communication, no surprises for the customer and quality delivery. 
- Standardised ingestion and egress solutions are required to support the target markets and maximise commercial channel opportunities, e.g Salesforce, Databricks
- Reporting and infrastructure billing needs to be easily accessible 
- Sales require clear demos and rapid POVs
- Documentation, tools and guided onboarding is required to support pre-sales, sales and CS. 



1. **Lift & Edge** need to support each other, so buying both creates considerably more customer value than buying either one independently, i.e. 1+1 =11. 
   1. Seamless low friction upsell opportunity 
   2. Combining data sources of Lift and Edge should generate bigger value
2. **Agentic event-driven intent prediction agnostic to data sources** (and continuously trained with multiple data sources) has enormous potential across all our ICP markets and an opportunity to create enterprise value through IP. 
   1. Intent predictions consumed technically (eg API) opens up workflow integration 
   2. Intents delivery new audience creation opportunities 
3. The **causal** use case supports the sales conversations and possibly conversion 
4. **Integrating with 3rd parties** to support channel partner effectiveness will generate new leads and deals. 
5. **Delivering insights or intents** using data from integrations will broaden our effective ICP
6. **Increasing insight or intent consumption** will drive customer value and revenue

## Criteria to evaluate value for prioritisation

Throughout prioritisation, products are required to consider value. In most feature-level cases, value is ambiguous and complicated, if not impossible, to attribute to direct repeatable revenue. The purpose of the Product Value Creation Plan (VCP)

1. Increase T1 customer customer/prospect of insights or intents (via any channel)
2. Increase sales staff confidence surrounding product delivery
3. Increase data consumed or shared with integrated partners
4. Increase revenue for iHQ. 
5. Strategic alignment

When projects or features are evaluated with equal weighting, the above four metrics will be considered to arrive at a value comparison.

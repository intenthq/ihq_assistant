Our aim is to help data-rich consumer businesses to rise above the noise of mass marketing, and engage

with their customers at the moments that matter to them.  This leads to **happier customers** that feel more connected to the brand, less marketing waste (and lower costs) with **better performance** and surprisingly, ***improved*** **privacy governance**. We call this **True Personalization**.



We do this by providing the **behavioural insight** and the **ML infrastructure** for **data-driven customer operations and decision making**. Our products serve as the **glue between an organisation’s customer data, its analytics capabilities, and its engagement with the customer**. 



Our products tie these together by bringing the **right data** (specific insight from trillions of rows of data) **to the people who need it**, allowing them to take data-driven decisions, conduct sophisticated analytics, and refine customer engagement through feedback. 



We **license this software to organisations on a subscription/use bases**, who receive **secure and unique instances of our platforms in which to conduct their own work on their own data**.

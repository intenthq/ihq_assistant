> Valuation is not and should not be the primary driver of our business – Businesses succeed by creating new markets and new value with less friction/cost than incumbents. 

### How we (and VCs) assess our company value

We use benchmarks from GP Bullhound and periodically have a third party assess the benchmarks of a cohort of 20 similar companies. The last of these assessments was in April 2020 by Portico Capital.

The primary method is to take the run rate (next 12 months revenue) at the end of the current year and select a revenue multiple to apply

   1. **The current average multiple is 6.3x recurring revenues** (Licences in our parlance) and 1x Professional Services fees. The range is typically 5-12x
   2. **The actual revenue multiple is based on:**
      1. **Revenue & margin growth** (2 yrs forward) (e.g. at 60% growth over 2 yrs the multiple is 6.3, at 90% it’s 8.3)
         1. Significant recent investments that can drive double digit growth (Median 17%)
         2. Profitability & EBITDA (Avg. 36% / 25% growth 2yr forward)
      2. **How repeatable / safe is the revenue stream**
         1. % product subscription revenues 
         2. Perceived risk of revenue concentration — 12% spread (but high is the largest deal blocker)
            1. *Low***:** Top 1 customer <10% and Top 5 <20% and Top 10 <35%
            2. *Medium***:** Top 1 customer <15% and Top 5 <30% and Top 10 <50%
            3. *High***:** Top 1 customer >15% and/or Top 5 >30% and/or Top 10 >50%
         3. Retention rates (Median 91%)
      3. **Business model**
         1. Proprietary data — 20% spread (yes, no, Blend)
         2. Proprietary analytics — 35% spread (yes, no)
         3. Tech Enabled — 33% spread (Highly enabled, Less enabled)
         4. Market position (Leader/follower)
         5. Geographic spread (Local, Regional, Global) — 30% spread

### Intent’s biggest valuation drivers over the next 2 years

   1. **Growth** in product Licence revenue
   2. **Increase** in % of subscription revenue (reduction in PS)
   3. **Demonstrated ability** to move into new markets
   4. **Reduction** in concentration risk



**Notes of caution**. 

   1. Other factors besides the above can and often do play a bigger role in valuations. For example, some businesses may have a distribution system that take your core product and massively accelerate revenues by pushing it through their own distribution channels.
   2. Businesses ***are bought, not sold***

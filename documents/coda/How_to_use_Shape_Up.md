We’ve adopted using the 37signals Shape Up process to define our ideas and roadmap items so they’re ready for build. 

This process follows a structured approach that involves three main parts: Shaping, Betting, and Building. Here's a breakdown of how the Shape Up process works:  
  






## **Shaping:**

1. **Work Shaping**: Before starting a project, a small senior group shapes the work by defining key elements of a solution. This step ensures that projects are well-defined and ready for development.
2. **Appetite Over Estimates**: Focus less on estimates and more on your team's appetite for the work. Determine how much time you want to spend on a project rather than how long it will take.
3. **Autonomy**: Give full responsibility to a small integrated team of designers and programmers. Allow them to define tasks, adjust scope, and work together to build vertical slices of the product.

## **Betting:**

1. **Choosing Projects**: Senior members come together at the betting table to discuss which projects to work on during a cycle. Decisions are driven by pre-prepared pitches for individual projects that members debate on.
2. **No Veto Power**: There's no need for higher authority to veto bets. Stakeholders place bets to decide which pitches make it into a cycle.

## **Building:**

1. **Six-Week Cycles**: Work in six-week cycles where most new features are built and released within one cycle. This timeframe is long enough to build something meaningful yet short enough to maintain focus and efficiency.
2. **Clear Responsibilities**: Make teams responsible for defining their own tasks, adjusting scope, and working together to build the product one step at a time.
3. **Targeting Risk**: Throughout the process, target the risk of not shipping on time rather than building the wrong thing.

The cross-functional structures for ProdTech (Build) are new to iHQ. The structure and staff allocation will change over the year based on project variation. This document outlines the initial shape and the phased approach.  
  
The initial teams are less cross-functional than we desire. However, this is due to carrying over existing projects; as new projects start, they will be designed to be value-creating end to end and, as such, will require more functions in each team. This gives the ProdTech org more time to adapt. to change instead of a big bang. 



# Team Breakdown

| Team | Draft Purpose *teams to complete |
| --- | --- |
| **Foundation Team** | Deliver a customer portal for administration and billing, tools for insight exploration, configuration, and valuable use cases solutions. |
| **Forward Deployed Team** | Some members of this team are from Serve. <br/><br/>**Purpose**: Provision demos and solutions to customers while supporting the sales and solution design process. This includes PoV and onboarding. This team owns automation and management tooling. |
| **Cloud Insight Team** | Delivers consumer insights and intents that are accessible for customers to consume and internal teams such as ADS or FDT and ensuring viable costings.   |
| **Device Insight Team** | Manage and automate insight creation on devices with egress options to the cloud or directly to customers. |


# Line management

Line management is handled by the Engineering Manager and is decoupled from: 

- Technical leadership **might happen by co-incidence*
- Task delegation

The Engineering Manager or Director of Engineering will provide pastoral care, associated administration, personal development planning and implementation of working methods. This approach enables a far greater staff span per line manager than typical. The org chart below shows the line managers and the roles under each. 



## Engineering Managers
| Name | Job Title |
| --- | --- |
| Albert Pastrana | Director of engineering, GM (Bcn) |
| Tomer Lekach | Head of mobile engineering |
| Javier Pedreira | Engineering manager |


The role of Product Managers is to support the operation of cross-functional teams and enable self-managed teams. The Forward Deployed team does not have a Product Manager - they have an Onboarding Manager and, when required, a Product Delivery & Ops Manager providing project management support.

# Proposed Q1 Team Projects

As we ease into cross-functional ways of working and self-managed teams with existing work, we will keep some familiarity with project selection per team. As we gain comfort and projects become bolder, the staff in each team will flex to ensure greater ownership of value delivery. 

| Team | Project candidates |
| --- | --- |
| **Team** | **Project Candidates** |
| **Foundation** | Release guided Sales Demo, Sandbox, POC Sandbox with customer data, Lift-Edge integration v1, Build Edge data in lift for Sales Demo, Conversational interface ready for end users, Insight catalogue including usage based pricing |
| **Device Insight** | Improved Best Moment to Engage, Externally Sent Notifications Augmentation with Best Moment to Engage, Custom Micro-Segments Funnel, One Click Edge Integration, iOS Micro Segments |
| **Cloud Insight** | PET service (needed for MTN), Event-driven intents (include semantic embedding for intent graph), Real-time lookalikes, Optimise deletion service to reduce cost |
| **Forward Deployed** | MTN Delivery, Automated pipeline provision, Tool for Automated EDA for new clients, Learners (LLM analysis) to label data MVP |


# Phase One: Team allocation

The team allocation will be flex based on projects and individual personal development plans.  
  
Tech leads, such as Directors of Technology or Principal levels, support the team they are in with technical decisions. It is not a line management role, nor is it a job title, but a role within the team to mentor and support. In addition, there is a [community of practice](https://coda.io/d/_dgMDDph8PXa/_su1iS) with individuals organically leading.

## TechOps

Previously, we had a highly flexible approach to client deployment, and TechOps was configured and skilled to handle almost anything. Moving forward, as we enter a market with varied levels of technical maturity and commercial structure deals of lower individual values (but more of them), we must adapt our deployment approach. This means becoming more opinionated by providing a limited set of options for customers. To support high levels of customers, we require more templated deployment, reducing the deployment effort and complexity. This will also improve our ability to maintain systems across many customers without increasing our internal cost structure. This means our TechOps requirements are changing.  
  
To support and understand the changes, the individuals in the TechOps team are embedded in each cross-functional team; they are a proxy to the wider TechOps team and represent the TechOps team.  
  
By being far closer to the teams, each individual in TechOps can better understand the details around the challenges the teams face, and by fostering relationships with the Product Manager, they can see the future needs of the business.  
  
This empowers each individual in TechOps to better understand the problems and influence TechOps solutions for the future. It enables each individual to improve team performance pro-actively through TechOps optimisation or radical new approaches.  
  
To support TechOps daily, the Product Ops and Delivery Manager will oversee prioritisation and escalation while ensuring all TechOps effort is visible in Linear.  
  
The Build Ops meeting, which is made up of technical leaders, will support TechOps by resolving conflicting priorities and shaping the future TechOps strategy.

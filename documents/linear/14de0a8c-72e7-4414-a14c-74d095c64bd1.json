    "description": "We need a learner to classify the topics associated with a given domain.\n\nGoals:\n\n* Prompt LLM using generated topic definitions to classify correct topics\n* Experiment with different prompting techniques\n\nEvaluation:\n\n* Use Wikidata labels as ground truth\n* General EDA of outputs:\n  * Is the classification as expected? Do we get a lot of no confidence predictions? Do we get a skew/bias towards certain topics?\n* Q: Is there a manually labelled dataset available?",

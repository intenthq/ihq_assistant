*Intent HQ Data Scientists and ML Engineers provide the intelligence behind our products by creating Data Science solutions that enable our clients to provide a personalised service to their customers. This is a key priority for customer facing businesses as it results in both tangible (i.e. improved offer take rate increases revenue) and intangible business benefits (i.e. better customer experience through less spam positively impacting customer retention).* 

This is achieved through our Insights Explorer that enables clients to leverage customer data in new ways with the aim of creating actionable insights to influence how they interact with them. 

*The role of the Data Science and ML Engineering team is to:*

1. *Shape Data Science ideas that can add value and insight for our business users and design algorithmic approaches and data pipelines to serve them.*
2. *Experiment to prove the efficacy of ML approaches.*
3. *Productionise, test and automate these models*
4. *Deploy models to production, monitor their performance and refresh them when necessary*

Intent HQ was originally founded as **Global Dawn** in 2010. Global Dawn bought the IP and assets of 1Click2Fame (details below), which Jonathan and Lawrence founded — links to the business can be found below, but it essentially mined social media data for music interests to help upcoming Music Artists build fan bases and break into the market. 

The underlying premise for Intent HQ was that the world had failed to deliver on the original premise of the Internet - personalized everything and mass relevance. Instead it had become the dark ages for CRM with mass spamming and crass advertising. 

Jonathan’s time with Simon Cowell and Sony BMG in 2006 resulted in the conclusion that an internet only version of America’s got talent would not succeed for lack of meaningful interest data – cookie data was simply not good enough to form any real sense of relevance. The growth of the major social platforms, and their willingness to share data in the early days provided the first real opportunity to use data other than cookie’s to augment CRMs and create more human, more relevant profiles.

Early versions of the Intent HQ product integrated insights from social media (primarily Facebook and Twitter) with first-party data giving our customers the ability to overlay interests and other attitudinal data points on top of their own data. This technology relied on Facebook social logins in order to get raw likes. 

Our algorithms would add an extra layer of insight by translating these to interests and providing additional context for each customer. Early clients were broadcasters and publishers such as Sky Italia, Channel 4, The Food channel, where we demonstrated great performance using social data to enrich profiles, and use it either for loyalty & retention (Sky Italia) or better targeting via facebook for day to day publishers. 

In late 2013, Facebook had started to slowly restrict access to the data within their platform. The company faced a choice as to whether to move into the Ad world and use these insights there, or make a more significant move into customer insights with first party data. We were actively looking for opportunities to pivot when we started conversations with O2 in 2014. Telco was an obvious choice given its’ core data set was is arguably richer than Facebook’s. 

The company changed its name to Intent HQ in 2014, after we were frequently being mistaken for the Greek far right wing party “Golden Dawn”.

## 1Click2Fame Background

In 2008, amongst the rising success of YouTube, Jonathan founded a company named 1Click2Fame. The idea was simple; use YouTube and the exploding social media networks to discover, launch and promote new artist, musicians and performers. In 2011 it was the largest online talent competition which included partnerships with Pop Idol and Britains Got Talent and had over 5 million youtube and facebook views and visits. The social following was providing lots of data and we were using that to improve the reach and targeting of our own campaigns. It was our first glimpse into the potential value of data driven marketing. In 2012 1Click2Fame closed after four successful years.

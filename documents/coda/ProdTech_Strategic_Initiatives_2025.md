## Prodtech 2025 initiatives are to get us closer to our vision and support the business goals of reaching sustainable profit, AI excellence and a single platform

The 5 ProdTech objectives for 2025 ordered by prioritisation are:



## 1. Minutes Not Months

**Description:** Reduce deployment and management overheads (infra & people time) with repeatable operations, system optimisation, and internal use of AI. 

**Directional Support:** This objective will likely require effort such as:

- Standardised end-to-end customer experience, improving ProdTech touch points for pre-sales, sales, CS and the client.
- Event driven approach to reduce insight latency and management overheads. 
- Repeatable approaches such as templated data pipelines embracing 3rd party technology to both accelerate progress and increase market familiarity with our approaches (customer & future talent).
- Standard data collection mechanisms and increased usage of trending technologies such as Databricks Delta Sharing while reducing dependency on custom solutions. 
- Automation and standard operating process (ProdTech focus) for PoC and full deployment maximising off-the-shelf standard technology where possible, e.g. Databricks. 
- Reduce the time and cost of deletion service 
- Optimisation of infrastructure costs per client deployment or PoC. 

 **Desired Outcomes:** The objective will be achieved when:

- Data ingestion and processing to insight generation is near real-time, embracing event-driven processing.
- Reduced infrastructure, deployment and running overheads by at least 30%.
- Reduce people hours from 100s to 10s for end-to-end deployment.

## 2. Streamline Sales Solutions

**Description:** ProdTech integrates more closely with sales and support by providing clear product propositions and accessible demonstrations. 

**Directional Support:** This objective will likely require effort such as:

- ProdTech supplied technical documentation suitable for clients. 
- ProdTech product or system knowledge base is for internal use by pre-sales, sales, and cs. 
- Automation for demo provisions and sector/market-suitable demo data. 
- Demo insights such as a Causal or Safe Signals available to increase client urgency to close and onboard. 
- Technical information is available to the client in our single platform experience (aka the Hub). 
- System tools to support standardised end-to-end customer experience, improving ProdTech touch points for pre-sales, sales, CS.

 **Desired Outcomes:** The objective will be achieved when:

- Delight clients with world-class experience from pre-sales to demo and then PoC with documentation, guidance, and automation exploiting the Hub.
- Support sales to increase conversion with demo provision in 1 to 2 days and high-impact PoC, creating client urgency to buy. Eg Causal.

## 3. Behaviour Boost

**Description:** Evolve our models, pipeline and inference engine to support an event driven pipeline and micro behavioural intents powering the LMB with a strong bias towards beyond prediction of behaviour and international interests support from multiple data sources to drive revenue generation in 2025 and beyond. 

**Directional Support:** This objective will likely require effort such as:

- Strengthened and new insights generation from Edge data.
- Enrich and mature the Intent Graph with semantically and behaviourally rich representations. 
- New insight combined Lift and Edge insight generation.
- Explore the potential of reusable insight patterns (or behaviour indices) to discover insights beyond weblogs across multiple datasets where accuracy or insight volume increases with additional datasets.

 **Desired Outcomes:** The objective will be achieved when:

- New repeatably deployable insights extending on causal 
- New repeatable insight potential from multiple datasets considering lifestyle changes, considered purchases and triggers of intent.
- Improve sales conversion by delivering insights for non-Telco prospects. 

## 4. Integrate Insights Intelligently

**Description:** Integrate our user experiences to a single solution (aka the Hub), providing a shared experience between Edge and Lift customers, increasing clientâ€™s awareness of available insights and preparing for an insight consumption pricing model.

**Directional Support:** This objective will likely require effort such as:

- Edge integration into IE / Hub
- Enable other teams to easily expose insights through IE / the Hub. 
- Natural language access to insights
- Audience building (Causal, Look a likes and IE filters) through the NLQ interface
- Landing Page / Catalogue V1 to drive insight discovery and cross sell

 **Desired Outcomes:** The objective will be achieved when:

- Unified smooth user experience with natural language across product lines in a single hub.
- Increase opportunity for cross-selling insight sources Edge and Lift and prepare for expansion to mid-market enterprises.
- Simplify insight consumption with basic catalogue capabilities.

## 5. Cultivate Consumption Channels

**Description:**  Demonstrate potential both commercially and technologically for API / workflow integration customer interactions, making the most of partnerships with businesses such as Databricks and Salesforce.  

**Directional Support:** This objective will likely require effort such as:

- Insights from Edge integrated with Salesforce Data Cloud
- Enhanced Edge insights or making insights actionable 
- Advanced insights provisioning for client data scientists

 **Desired Outcomes:** The objective will be achieved when:

-  New GTM potential through deeper integration with partners such as Salesforce.
- Grow insight consumption using integration with operational systems such as Salesforce.
- Demonstrate pipeline and revenue growth specifically in non Telco.

# Executive summary

[Brief description of the project, to expand on the name/title]

# Guidelines for the lead Data Scientist

1. Go to the [https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suDbY](https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suDbY) page to see more information on the framework we follow and to find general guidelines.
2. Start with the Shape stage here: **[https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_supYJ](https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_supYJ)**
   1. Check out the link at the top of the page if you need specific stage guidelines 
   2. Once all the mandatory actions are completed (and documented in the checklist table), set up a Gate Meeting with key stakeholders
3. Once all stakeholders have signed off on the **Shape Gate** checklist, proceed to the next stage: **[https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suyFu](https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suyFu)**
   1. Repeat the process as with the first stage. The only difference is that instead of a Gate, we have a Checkpoint - a less formal point of transition to the next stage.
4. Once you have completed all the Checkpoint actions in the **Data Driven Design** stage, proceed to: **[https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suVYr](https://coda.io/d/_dK5h4iVEEUo/_suVYr)**

### **1. Defining the Purpose and Structure**

- Identify **key technology areas** that would benefit from a CoP (e.g., DevSecOps, Frontend, AI & ML, Cloud, Security, etc.).
- Define **guiding principles**—CoPs should be **voluntary, cross-functional, and driven by shared learning**.
- Assign **sponsors and facilitators** (not managers, but engaged practitioners).
- Members should be able to support one another through dedicated Slack channels.



### **2. Governance and Responsibilities**

- **CoP Sponsor** (Senior leader or Principal Engineer)

  - Organises discussions and events
  - Encourages participation
  - Shares key insights with the wider org
- **CoP Members** (Anyone interested)
  - Contribute experiences, questions, and ideas
  - Participate in meetings and discussions



### **3. Meeting Cadence**

- **Kickoff Meeting** (Once per CoP formation)
  - Define goals, initial focus, and success criteria
- **Regular CoP Meetings** (Every 2–4 weeks)
  - Rotating topics (e.g., lightning talks, problem-solving)
  - Demos of new tech, POCs, or best practices
- **Quarterly CoP Sync** (All CoPs come together)
  - Share learnings across CoPs
  - Cross-functional discussions and alignment
- **Annual Internal Conference** 
  - In person internal 'tech day' where CoPs present their key insights



### **4. Communication & Knowledge Sharing**

- **Slack Channels**
  - Dedicated channel per CoP for async discussions
  - Share articles, event invites, challenges, questions, and support
- **Coda Pages**
  - Living documentation of key insights, best practices, and lessons learned
  - Meeting notes and action points
  - Monthly updates summarising discussions, new tech trends, and key takeaways
- **Tech Radar across all CoPs**
  - On Coda, maintain a department-wide "Tech Radar" to track emerging technologies, frameworks, and internal experiments - eg [https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)



### **5. Integrating with the Broader Organisation**

- **Leadership Buy-in**
  - Ensure senior and principal technical staff and directors actively engage
  - Recognise CoP contributions in performance reviews
- **Linking CoPs to Delivery Work**
  - Encourage CoPs to contribute to technical decisions
  - Identify opportunities for pilot projects, innovation sprints, or design sprints
- **Encourage External Engagement**
  - Support CoP members to speak at conferences or publish blog posts
  - Invite external guests to speak at our CoP meetings. 



### **6. Feedback & Evolution**

- **Regular Syncs**
  - Pulse surveys to gauge engagement and value
  - Retrospectives every 6 months to refine the approach
- **Adaptation**
  - If a CoP is not adding value, pivot its focus or sunset it
  - Spin up new CoPs as tech evolves

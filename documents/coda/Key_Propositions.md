### The chart our buyers (CMOs who own base revenue) look at *every week*

They face intense margin pressure



*Essentially, what’s my change in net base revenue, and where am I winning or losing*



### To win, they need to “know more about a customer” and translate that into value.

The deeper challenges they face doing this are:

| Challenge | The essence of the problem |
| --- | --- |
| The **understanding me** challenge | How can I understand my customers well enough to make a difference? Both to them individually, and to my business performance. |
| The **data for AI** challenge | Our AI is only as good as the data we use. How can we get more signal? (network / viewing data) |
| The **Privacy** challenge | How can we ensure we enforce policies, avoid being fined, and honour customer promises? |
| The **AI/ML** challenge | 80% of models don't make it to production. How can we change the game;  -make it easier to create and test models and faster to deploy?  |
| The **Silo** challenge | My profiles are different for each channels. How can we make sure we are congruent to the customer?   |




### How do we address these challenges with our products







### What's our (high level) galvanising story? Broadly...



**Tier 1 Telcos/CSPs and new sector entry**

>> This is our latest positioning, which recognises the applicability of our platform and capabilities across a broad range of sectors where the use of AI to create human understanding for subsequent use in marketing, or the incorporation of data features generated by our insights in easily deployable commercial models is particularly relevant.

| Heading | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **The change in the world.** | **There’s a growing personalization gap between haves and have-nots.**<br/><br/>Accelerating market leaders delivering relevant, predictive, organic-feeling customer interactions vs. Languishing laggards struggling to turn superficial relationships into real revenue.  |
| **The new potential.** | **Early leaders have invested billions industrialising true personalization at scale.** And customers have quickly acclimated to new standards of value and authenticity that superficial personalization can’t match. |
| **The obstacle.** | **True, scaled personalization has steep, complex, cross-functional requirements.** It’s the timely activation of rich human insight (created with highly sensitive data) through continuously improving data models with faultless privacy controls - all on-demand. |
| **The breakthrough.** | **Insight+Activation** **is an end-to-end workflow for the on-demand activation of human understanding at scale.** It combines AI-enriched human insights, accelerated ML and forensic explainability - wrapped up in pragmatic, self-serve use cases. |
| **The pay-off.** | **Insight+Activation closes the personalization gap and builds** **TRUE PERSONALISATION****.** This is a total personalization transformation that operationalizes high-value, automated, privacy-first customer outcomes that boost revenue and retention. |




**Tier 3 Telcos/CSPs**

>> This is the positioning from 2020, which still holds true for customers handling sensitive data but where the attributes of our platform around accelerated deployment and deployment of models incorporating data features generated by our insights is less immediately relevant.
>> 

| Heading | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **The change in the world.** | **New customers expectations are colliding with privacy restrictions.**<br/><br/>People used to Amazon and Netflix are disappointed by their telco experiences—but they expect their privacy to be protected. |
| **The new potential.** | **If telcos could tap their own user activity data responsibly, they could transform the customer experience**. Delivering relevant interactions everywhere while *improving* privacy and trust protections. |
| **The obstacle.** | **But today’s data platforms prevent you from harnessing your most valuable data.** The call logs, web visits and behaviour data users generate every hour of every day. |
| **The breakthrough.** | **Intent HQ is built to securely manage high volume sensitive data, enabling real-time models to drive flexible & rapid delivery of pesonalisation.** Making it easy to turn activities into insights into relevant actions, everywhere. |
| **The pay-off.** | **For the first time, telcos are now using their better-than-Facebook data to delight customers, increase revenues and protect margins** . All while improving privacy stewardship and ensuring data compliance. |

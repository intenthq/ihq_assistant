## Device Insight Team

### ðŸš€ Team Purpose

*Help our customers with mobile applications to understand their users to communicate better and engage with their users to support their business goals.*

### **What we do**

*Capture as much information from the mobile device via the SDK as possible  
Infer user behaviour from device sensors  
Analysis of user data for our customers, which might include customer-specific models  
Give insights into our customersâ€™ users so they can understand and interact with their end users  
Enrich customersâ€™ understanding of users, eg augmenting CRM data with insights eg countries visited, frequent flyer  
Help customers understand segments of the users  
Provide campaign and engagement management tools  
Improve customer marketing and automation with insights provided by us  
Please provide the best moment to engage to our customers  
Add context about our users  
Give customers triggers to action in their communications and engagement proactively  
Embed into our customer's applications and workflow so customers and programmatically react to triggers or events.  
Operate background data capture with battery efficiencies  
Protect the privacy of the user  
We work on iOS and Android and try to achieve similar results on iOS (albeit restricted by Apple)  
Proactively innovate and push boundaries with new features.  
We will use iHQ employees to support with testing and evaluation  
We collaborate more across iHQ ProdTech teams and be part of company-wide initiatives*

### **What we donâ€™t do**

*One SDK for all customers can download customer-specific models using it.  
We donâ€™t test on hardware across predefined devices in a device farm. Instead, a test application is deployed to many devices (cira 20k users - Android).  
We have less test production coverage on iOS  
We donâ€™t build applications for customers  
We donâ€™t formally support more than 3 versions of the operating system, although, in practice, we do go further back, especially on Android.*

### *Questions to explore*

**Interview questions**

- What is your role at Verizon?
- Why do you use AIA?
  - **Talk me through a typical session** - (ask them to bring it up and share screen)
    - (trying to understand if they do the same thing all the time or new tasks)
  - Once youâ€™ve completed a task in AIA, where does it go from there?
  - **What would you do if you didnâ€™t have access to AIA?** 
    - on a scale of 1-10, how useful do you find it? 
    - What do you need to get to a 10/10?
  - How many people are in your team?
    - What do they do & their responsibilities? 
    - Do they use AIA? Why/ Why not?
- **If you had 3 magic wishes to help you achieve your objectives, what would they be?**
  - If you had an AI assistant, what would you expect from it?

Likely to come out from above, but need to prompt them during the conversation if not.

- How do you use our brands insights?
- How do you use out topics insights?
- (Is there a distinction between them?
  - Might not ask this directly, but ultimately thatâ€™s what I want to find out.)

### Prep ðŸ‘‡

Who uses topics (and brands) at VZ most? Can we get on a couple interview to understand their use-cases, what they like and what they donâ€™t?

- Research questions - **turn into interview Qs**
  - Do you ever see differences between brands and topic insights? 
    - Do you like that or would you like them to be fully aligned all the time?
  - How do you use our behavioural insights?
    - Are there different use-cases between brands and topics?
  - How often do you use behavioural insights for audience building? % of total campaigns you run
  - How often do you feel like you need more users that match a certain behavioural profile? (hence perhaps recurring to using lookalike modelling instead to increase potential reach)
  - Are there any topics you find to be to generic/large volume? (e.g. social media)
  - How many topics should we have? Are all of them useful?
    -  What is a subset of important topics for you?
- These users have used both brands and topics, both as filters and as cards in the current quarter (past 3 months): 
  - Dip Jadiwala

*Note*: *There’s an overlap between the customer analytics market, and the Big data Analytics market, but we don’t have data on that currently - so think of us in the overlap*

## Current sector focus: Telco (CSPs)

Our primary and cornerstone market and focus is on **base management** (not acquisition) for  **the consumer divisions of CSPs** (Communication Service Providers).  With a prioritisation as follows:

   1. Consumer Telco (predominantly postpay markets)
   2. Cable operators
   3. Enterprise / B2B in Telco

### Telco Market sizing 

The Global Telecom Analytics Market size is expected to reach $8.7 billion by 2025 ([source](https://www.reportlinker.com/p05876910/Global-Telecom-Analytics-Market-By-Deployment-Type-By-Organization-Size-By-Application-By-Region-Industry-Analysis-and-Forecast.html?utm_source=GNW)), rising at a market growth of 13.3% CAGR during the forecast period. The purpose of telecom analytics is to reduce operating costs and maximize profits by increasing sales, reducing fraud, and optimizing risk management. The use of telecom analytics is intended to increase visibility in internal processes, core activities and market conditions, to distinguish trends and generate predictions.

Churn reduction requires increase, fraud detection demand due to increased number of network attacks and the need to streamline revenue management operations are expected to influence the growth of the global telecom analytics market. However, lack of awareness of solutions in the field of telecom analytics is expected to limit market growth. On the contrary, an increase in the adoption of new technologies like AI and telecom analytics machine learning is expected to present profitable market expansion opportunities.



### Geographic focus

We have a focus in 2 regions - Europe and the US.





The nature of the Telco market is that there are:

- only a small number of prospects in each country
- they are ofter linked via conglomerates like Vodafone or Telefónica, which further concentrates the market, but also offers a multi-country rollout path with group endorsement
- This implies a high touch, consultative sales approach

## Future markets

*Based on characteristics that suit our Product proposition*

We believe we have **a strong opportunity in markets with these characteristics**

   1. High competition and low barriers to change for the consumer
   2. Where there is market saturation, and *competitive* *differentiation is effected via customer centricity* 
   3. Large number of customers (>1m)
   4. Where compliance is critical
   5. *Frequent customer interactions and repeat transactions* e.g. Finance, Insurance, Health, Government, Retail
   6. *Medium to high CLV* (Customer Lifetime Value)
   7. A focus on customer retention
   8. *Significant data exhaust from core business operations*

When these characteristics are satisfied we often see that data-driven marketing approaches are most relevant and effective.

- **We want to test one new market** (potentially Retail, e-commerce, Finance or Finance/retail intersection) ASAP, essentially to validate the opportunity. 
- We will reactively qualify other opportunities, and determine at the time where they could be a useful fit, or a distraction.

### Other options

- The Customer ML platform can provide a horizontal, rather than vertical market play. This is true whether it is sold with or without the Feature Catalogue.
- Other components that we build for the end-to-end serviced platform may be sold in isolation of the full suite. 

### Exclusions

Some commentary on explicit discards;

- Asian markets have been discarded due to language barriers and working hours for support although we have entertained some sales conversations previously
- B2B markets have largely been ruled out due the volume of transactions being low. There have been some discussions with the B2B arms of a primarily consumer brand as a means to access the core B2C opportunity.
- We have largely excluded volume based inbound sales channels due to the large cost, low-volume nature of our B2B sales strategy.

Once we have a full week of data we can run some analysis to indicate a reasonable number to avoid missing significant data\n* we can process day D once all of the weblogs for D, **and also** `D+i` **where** `0<i<=N`, have arrived\n* for each day ready for processing, we read in all the files for that day, and those for each D+i as above, filtering to records where `Begin_Dt == D`\n* Then we group, count, and sum up the   ",
